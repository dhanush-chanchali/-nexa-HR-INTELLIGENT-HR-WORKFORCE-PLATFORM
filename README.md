## 💾 Data Persistence

This prototype uses a client-side mock store powered by `window.localStorage`. Actions persist between page refreshes and browser sessions:
- Active authenticated session & selected role
- Dark / Light theme preference
- Attendance check-in / check-out times
- Submitted leave requests & approval states
- Newly added or modified employee records
- Expense claims & announcements

To reset back to default seed data, simply clear your browser's `localStorage` for `localhost:5173`.
